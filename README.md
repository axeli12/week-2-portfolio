# CSS Portfolio!

## For this weeks challenge we were given an assignment to make a CSS Portfolio with working links into section of the page.
The motivation for this webpage was to be able to have all my work in one section for anyone to see and to see what i have been able to make. There is three sections in this webpage the about-me where it gives a little description about me and why I enrolled into this coding bootcamp. The work section is a section of some of the projects that I have coded or have worked on, lastly there is the contact-me section where my github is linked, there is alse my and my email is on there as, Also there is a phone number section and a twitter link for socials.

The main reason for this project was to have an easy place to gather all my work and somethings about me and how to reach me, and also to see the work that I have done and how it is built.
